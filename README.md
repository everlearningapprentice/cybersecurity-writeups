# Overview
This repository contains a collection of technical writeups, vulnerability analyses, and independent research on emerging and past threats through various TryHackMe and Hack The Box labs. Each writeup is structured based on the research objective.
## Cybersecurity Lab Documentation
The first type of documentation that focuses on the lab materials and the provided problem.
* **Chronological Timeline of Events:** Authored step-by-step technical logs documenting the full lifecycle of an exploit.
* **Artifact Analysis:** Conducted deep-dive examinations of system artifacts (logs, file metadata, and registry changes) to identify indicators of compromise and system vulnerabilities.
* **Solutions:** Only for non-challenge labs. Provided validated answers mapped directly to specific evidence and analysis sections within the writeup.
## Systematic Case Studies
The second type of documentation that explores current threats, such as SaltTyphoon.
* **Threat Synthesis:** Documenting the lifecycle of breaches with a focus on Infrastructure Vulnerabilities and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).
* **Framework Mapping:** Categorizing threat actor behavior using the MITRE ATT&CK framework to identify specific stages of the cyber kill chain.
* **Vulnerability Tracking:** Cross-referencing active exploits with official CVE IDs and CVSS scores to assess architectural impact and potential risk levels for distributed systems.
